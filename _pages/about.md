# About Me

I am a senior undergraduate student from School of Eletronic Engineering and Computer Science in **Peking University** with a major in Computer Science, Department of Machine Intelligence.

My research interest lie predominately in **Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence**. At present, I have been conducting researches on **Computational Photography**, including Image Restoration and Enhancement, Image Enhancing and Matting, analysis on Generative Models and Realistic Image Quality Assessments.

I am now working as an research assistant under the supervision of Prof. [Ming-Hsuan Yang](https://faculty.ucmerced.edu/mhyang/) *et al.* for discovering Image Generative and Reconstructive models. I am also a research intern of Research Group, [Megvii Incorporated](https://megvii.com/) for image enhancement research programs. Since Summer 2019, I was affliated with *[Visual Inference and Evaluation](https://vie.group/)* Group in Peking University as a research assistant advidsed by Asso. Prof. Tingting Jiang.
